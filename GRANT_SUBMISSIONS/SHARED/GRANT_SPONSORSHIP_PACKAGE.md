# SolarPunk Protocol - Sponsorship & Grant Application Package
**Version 1.0 | January 2026**

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE BRIEF (One-Pager)

### The Problem
Renewable energy revenues are highly volatile and most producers can’t access hedging. Solar farms face **189% price volatility** and curtailment losses, while traditional derivatives only serve very large producers. **Result:** a $100B+ market exists, but smaller producers are locked out.

### The Solution
**SolarPunk Protocol** is a decentralized energy-derivatives platform on Polygon that prices options with **NASA POWER** satellite data and settles on-chain.

| Pillar | Status | Tech |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Settlement Layer** | ✅ Complete | Solidity (EVM) |
| **Pricing Engine** | ✅ Complete | Python quantitative finance |
| **Data Foundation** | ✅ Complete | NASA POWER API (free, global) |

### Ask & Timeline
- **Request:** $50-75K grant for a 6‑month execution window
- **Deliverables:** Testnet launch → pilot trades → mainnet readiness
- **Target outcome:** 30+ pilot farms engaged, $10M+ options volume in year 1

### Why Now
- MVP complete (46 passing tests)
- NASA POWER data integration already implemented
- Polygon’s climate/RWA focus is a direct fit

## ✨ FINAL PITCH

**SolarPunk is the missing piece of renewable energy infrastructure.**

Traditional derivatives exclude most renewable producers. We’re building open, verifiable hedging for the long tail of energy markets.

**With your grant, we can:**
1. De‑risk the technology (audit)
2. Prove demand (pilot trades)
3. Launch responsibly (mainnet readiness)

By Year 2, we aim to hedge **10,000+ MW** of renewable capacity—equivalent to preventing **$500M in annual revenue loss** across the industry.

**This is financial infrastructure for the energy transition.**
