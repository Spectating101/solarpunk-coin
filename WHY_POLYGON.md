# Why Polygon? (200 words)

Polygon is the only major L2 with a dedicated climate-focused grants program, making it the natural home for renewable energy infrastructure. Our protocol solves a $500M market inefficiency in renewable hedging—exactly the type of high-impact, technically rigorous project Polygon Season 3 prioritizes.

**Technical Fit:** We chose Polygon PoS for three reasons: (1) sub-cent transaction costs enable micro-hedging for small solar farms, (2) 2-second finality supports real-time energy pricing, and (3) mature DeFi ecosystem (Aave, Uniswap) provides liquidity infrastructure we can integrate immediately.

**Ecosystem Alignment:** Polygon's sustainability commitment (carbon-negative chain) aligns perfectly with our mission to accelerate renewable adoption. By solving price risk for solar/wind producers, we directly enable green energy financing—the farms we hedge will add 1,000+ MW of clean capacity by year 2.

**Go-to-Market:** Polygon's network includes energy-focused projects (KlimaDAO, Offsetra) that create natural partnership opportunities. We're not bringing energy to crypto—we're bringing crypto's solution to energy's $500M problem.

**Deployment Plan:** Testnet launch in 30 days on Polygon Amoy, mainnet by Q2 2026. We're production-ready with 46/46 tests passing and seeking grant support for audit + pilot deployment.
