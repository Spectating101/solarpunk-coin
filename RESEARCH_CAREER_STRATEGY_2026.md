# RESEARCH CAREER STRATEGY 2026: The "Research Engineer" Pivot

**Status:** Strategic Pivot
**Objective:** Leverage technical skillset (`Python`, `NLP`, `Quant`) to secure high-value Research Assistant (RA) or Research Engineer roles, moving beyond generic "economics student" applications.

---

## 1. THE CORE PIVOT
**Old Strategy:** "I am a Master's student in Taiwan with good grades." (Low conversion, high competition).
**New Strategy:** "I am a Full-Stack Research Engineer who automates knowledge work and builds proprietary datasets." (High conversion, specific niche).

### The "Asset Audit"
You possess three specific "Superpowers" that traditional RAs lack:
1.  **Automation:** You built `cite-agent` (automating consensus tracking).
2.  **Engineering:** You built `energy_derivatives` (production-grade quant library).
3.  **Data Mining:** You built `Invisible Ledger` (scraping/ETL of non-standard financial data).

## 2. THE PORTFOLIO PACKAGING
Do not send a CV. Send a **"Portfolio Kit"** that links to your code.

### A. The Flagship: `cite-agent` (The "Job Killer")
*   **Pitch:** "I don't just read papers; I built an engine that tracks ArXiv consensus automatically."
*   **Target Audience:** Tech Policy labs (TPI), AI Startups (Elicit), Overworked Professors.
*   **Key Tech:** Python, LLMs, APIs, Docker/Fly.io.

### B. The Quant Proof: `energy_derivatives` (The "Math")
*   **Pitch:** "I implemented NASA-calibrated stochastic pricing models in Python."
*   **Target Audience:** Quant Finance labs (Wharton/Chicago), Crypto Research (Paradigm/Flashbots).
*   **Key Tech:** Monte Carlo, Binomial Trees, Stochastic Calculus.

### C. The Data Proof: `Invisible Economy` (The "Scoop")
*   **Pitch:** "I discovered an $185B economic gap by scraping 5 years of SEC/IDX filings."
*   **Target Audience:** Development Econ (J-PAL), Journalism (Rest of World).
*   **Key Tech:** Web Scraping, PDF Parsing, Unstructured Data Analysis.

## 3. THE "SNIPER" HIT LIST (Verified Targets)

### Tier 1: The "Perfect Fit" (AI for Research)
*   **Elicit / Ought** ([Careers](https://elicit.com/careers))
    *   **Role:** Research Engineer / AI Engineer.
    *   **Why:** They are literally building `cite-agent` as a business. You have already built their product prototype.
    *   **Strategy:** Apply with GitHub link. "I built an open-source consensus engine similar to Elicit."

*   **Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET)** ([Careers](https://cset.georgetown.edu/careers/))
    *   **Role:** Data Research Analyst.
    *   **Why:** They use data/citations to track AI progress.
    *   **Strategy:** Highlight your ability to scrape and analyze bibliometric data.

### Tier 2: The "Tech Policy" Labs (Remote Friendly)
*   **The Technology Policy Institute (TPI)** ([Contact](https://techpolicyinstitute.org/careers/))
    *   **Role:** Research Analyst / Fellow.
    *   **Why:** They need web apps for policy analysis.
    *   **Strategy:** Email `info@` directly. "I build Python tools for automated policy tracking."

*   **Brookings Institution (AI & Emerging Tech)**
    *   **Role:** Research Assistant (AI).
    *   **Why:** Measuring the "AI Economy" requires the data scraping skills you used for the Invisible Ledger.

### Tier 3: The "Quant" Hubs
*   **NBER / PREDOC.org** ([NBER Jobs](https://www.nber.org/career-resources/research-assistant-positions-not-nber))
    *   **Role:** "Pre-Doctoral Research Associate" (Finance/Macro).
    *   **Filter:** Search for "Asset Pricing" or "Big Data."
    *   **Strategy:** Use `energy_derivatives` as your work sample.
