## EMAIL TEMPLATE (Send to solar farm companies)

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity - Renewable Energy Hedging Protocol (Testnet Pilot)

---

Dear [Company Name] Solar Operations Team,

We are developing **SolarPunk**, a decentralized protocol for renewable energy derivatives that allows solar farms to hedge their energy price risk.

**The Problem We Solve:**
Solar farms face 189% annual price volatility on renewable energy sales, making long-term revenue planning unpredictable. Traditional hedging requires intermediaries and is expensive.

**Our Solution:**
SolarPunk is an open-source, blockchain-based protocol that lets solar farms hedge their renewable energy production directly, with no middleman. Using real-time NASA satellite data, we price derivatives based on actual weather conditions your farm experiences.

**We're Looking For:**
3-5 solar farms to participate in a **3-month testnet pilot** (Jan-March 2026):
- **Time commitment:** 4-6 hours setup, then ~1 hour/week monitoring
- **Cost to you:** FREE (we provide all technology)
- **What you get:** Early access to hedging tools + revenue sharing (if you go to mainnet)
- **Data sharing:** Anonymous aggregated data for research (no sensitive production data needed)

**What Happens:**
1. **Month 1:** We deploy to testnet on Polygon, integrate your farm's data via NASA API
2. **Month 2:** You execute 2-3 test hedges (simulated trades, no real money)
3. **Month 3:** Data analysis + feedback for mainnet launch

**Why Participate:**
- Be early adopter of renewable hedging technology
- Direct input on product design
- Revenue sharing when mainnet launches
- Help shape the future of renewable energy finance

**Next Steps:**
If interested, please reply with:
- [ ] Confirmation of interest
- [ ] Estimated MW capacity of your solar farm
- [ ] Primary contact + technical contact

**More Info:**
- Website: [Your website - if you have one]
- GitHub: [SolarPunk repo link]
- Tech Spec: [THOROUGH_ASSESSMENT.md link]

We're moving quickly and would like to finalize pilots by **January 31, 2026**.

Looking forward to partnering!

Best regards,
[Your name]
SolarPunk Protocol

## FOLLOW-UP EMAIL (If no response in 5 days)

Subject: RE: Partnership Opportunity - Renewable Energy Hedging (Quick Question)

Hi [Name],

Following up on my previous email about the SolarPunk renewable energy hedging pilot.

No pressure if you're not interested, but I wanted to check: Would a **3-month free pilot** be something your farm would consider?

The main ask is just 4-6 hours of setup time and ~1 hour/week for monitoring. In exchange, you get early access to hedging technology + input on the product roadmap.

If you're curious but want more details, I'm happy to jump on a quick call.

Thanks,
[Your name]
