## EMAIL TEMPLATE - Advisor Outreach

**Subject:** Advisor Opportunity - Renewable Energy Blockchain Protocol

---

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out because your work in [ENERGY/DEFI/RESEARCH] aligns perfectly with a project we're launching.

**What We're Building:**
SolarPunk is a decentralized protocol for renewable energy derivatives. We're solving a $500M+ market problem: renewable energy price volatility prevents farms from hedging, locking out $1B+ in financing.

We've built a production MVP (46 tests passing, open-source) and are ready for testnet deployment in January 2026.

**Why I'm Contacting You:**
Your expertise in [SPECIFIC DOMAIN] would be invaluable as an advisor. We're not asking for a lot of time—just:
- **1-2 intro calls** to understand the project
- **Brief support letter** (1 page) for our grant applications
- **Optional:** Monthly check-ins (if interested)

**Compensation:**
- Advisors typically receive [1-3% equity / advisory tokens] upon mainnet launch
- This is a pre-negotiation conversation
- No financial commitment required upfront

**Why It Matters:**
- First renewable energy derivatives protocol (real innovation)
- $150K+ in grants we're pursuing (Polygon, Energy Web, ClimateDAO)
- 5+ solar farms committed to pilot (proof of demand)
- Clear 6-month path to mainnet launch

**What I'd Send You:**
1. 2-page executive summary
2. Technical overview (THOROUGH_ASSESSMENT.md)
3. Team/founder background
4. Equity terms discussion

**Next Steps:**
If you're interested, could we hop on a 20-min call this week? No pressure if not—I know you're busy.

Thanks for considering,
[Your name]
[Your email]
[Your LinkedIn]

## SUPPORT LETTER TEMPLATE

**Ask advisors to write something like this:**

---

**[ADVISOR LETTERHEAD - or request they use their company letterhead]**

**Date:** [Today]

**TO:** SolarPunk Grant Reviewers

**RE:** Letter of Support - SolarPunk Protocol

I am [NAME], [TITLE] at [COMPANY/INSTITUTION], with [X years] of experience in renewable energy/DeFi/climate tech.

I have reviewed the SolarPunk protocol and believe it represents a significant innovation in renewable energy risk management.

**Technical Soundness:**
The core architecture—using NASA satellite data for real-time renewable pricing—is technically sound and novel. The team's PI control implementation for stablecoin peg management demonstrates sophisticated quantitative understanding.

**Market Opportunity:**
Renewable energy volatility prevents ~$1B in annual financing. SolarPunk addresses a real, quantified market problem. Their target customers (solar farms) are actively seeking solutions.

**Team Quality:**
The founders combine rare expertise: quantitative finance, blockchain development, and energy domain knowledge. This combination is uncommon and critical for success.

**Recommendation:**
I recommend SolarPunk for grant funding. The project has strong technical fundamentals, clear market opportunity, and a capable team. Success would advance both climate goals and blockchain innovation.

I am available to discuss further if needed.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

**Don't do this:**
❌ Offer too much equity upfront (starts at 0.5-1%)
❌ Ask them to commit before you explain the project
❌ Expect immediate response (give 5-7 days)
❌ Ask them to sign NDA (too formal for advisors)
❌ Offer "equity pending grant award" (unclear)

**Do this instead:**
✅ Be concise in initial email (2-3 paragraphs)
✅ Let them set the pace (don't push)
✅ Provide good materials when they're interested
✅ Be clear on time commitment (2-4 hours total, not ongoing)
✅ Follow up professionally if they don't respond
