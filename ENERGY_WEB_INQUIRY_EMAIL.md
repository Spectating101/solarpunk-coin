**Subject:** Grant Application Inquiry - Decentralized Energy Derivatives Protocol

---

Dear Energy Web Foundation Team,

I'm reaching out to inquire about grant opportunities for **SolarPunk Protocol**, a decentralized derivatives platform enabling renewable energy producers to hedge price and volume risk on-chain.

### Project Summary
We've built production-ready smart contracts (46/46 tests passing) that allow solar farms to hedge against:
- Energy price volatility (189% annualized for renewables)
- Curtailment risk (grid oversupply leading to forced shutdowns)
- Revenue uncertainty (blocking project financing)

Our protocol integrates NASA satellite data for transparent pricing and supports multi-energy sources (solar, wind, hydro) from day one.

### Energy Web Alignment
We see strong integration potential with Energy Web's ecosystem:
- **EW-DOS Integration:** Use self-sovereign identity for participant verification
- **Green Proofs API:** Verify production claims before issuing derivative contracts
- **Energy Web Chain Deployment:** Primary network for enterprise-focused deployment
- **FlexibilityOS Bridge:** Provide hedging data to grid operators for dispatch planning

(Full integration specification attached: ENERGY_WEB_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md)

### Current Status
- **Code:** Production-ready (Solidity 0.8.20, Hardhat, 46/46 tests)
- **Pricing Engine:** Python library with NASA POWER API integration
- **Oracle Service:** FastAPI containerized deployment
- **Research:** Published master's thesis on energy-cost cryptocurrency anchoring
- **Pilots:** Outreach to 5 solar farm partners (LOIs in progress)

### Grant Request
We're seeking **$50-75K** to fund:
- Smart contract audit ($15K)
- Energy Web Chain integration development ($10K)
- EW-DOS + Green Proofs API integration ($8K)
- Testnet pilot with 3 solar farms ($12K)
- Operational costs (oracle hosting, docs) ($10K)

### Why This Matters
Small renewable producers (<500 MW) are locked out of traditional hedging markets, creating a $500M+ market inefficiency. By bringing derivatives on-chain with Energy Web's identity and proof infrastructure, we enable 1,000+ MW of renewable capacity to secure financing by year 2.

### Next Steps
If Energy Web Foundation is accepting grant applications, I'd be happy to:
1. Submit a formal proposal via your preferred portal
2. Provide additional technical documentation (architecture diagrams, test coverage, etc.)
3. Schedule a call to discuss integration opportunities

Thank you for considering this inquiry. I believe SolarPunk Protocol can meaningfully expand Energy Web's ecosystem by adding risk management infrastructure alongside your existing identity and coordination layers.

## Key Points to Emphasize in Call (If They Respond)

1. **We complement, not compete:** Fill the derivatives gap in EW ecosystem
2. **Enterprise-ready:** EW-DOS integration means compliance layer built-in
3. **Open-source commitment:** Will contribute code to EW repositories
4. **Ecosystem participant:** Join EW Developer Community, present at monthly calls
5. **Sector expertise:** Master's thesis on energy-crypto intersection, published research
