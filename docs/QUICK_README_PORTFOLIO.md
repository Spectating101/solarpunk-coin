- **LLM Hybrid Paper**: Complete manuscript `RESEARCH/chris_s1133958_final_paper.pdf`; submission notes and cover letter template in `RESEARCH/LLM_HYBRID_SUBMISSION.md`.

## Submission To-Dos
1) **VoxEU (Invisible Economy)**  
   - Review `Completed-Draft.md` briefly.  
   - Fill your name/contact in `COVER_LETTER_VoxEU.md`.  
   - Submit via VoxEU “Submit a Column”.  

2) **Digital Tax (ITPF)**  
   - Use `MANUSCRIPT_READY_FOR_PDF.md` as source.  
   - Add Figure 2 (event study: Malaysia vs Vietnam, quarters –4 to +4).  
   - Finalize tables if needed (Table 3: `derivation/tables/diD_table3.csv`; Table 6: `derivation/tables/robustness_table6_fixed.csv`).  
   - Fill `COVER_LETTER_ITPF.md` and submit to International Tax & Public Finance.  

3) **CEIR/SPK Paper + Thesis**  
   - Follow `docs/papers/CEIR_SPK_PAPER_OUTLINE.md` to assemble a journal-length paper.  
   - Include CEIR results, pricing/margin tables, simulation plots; add replication bundle (data/scripts/contracts).  
   - Thesis scaffolding in `docs/thesis/MASTER_THESIS_PROPOSAL.md`, `thesis-draft.md`.  

4) **LLM Hybrid**  
   - Pick a venue (applied ML/FinAI).  
   - Use `RESEARCH/LLM_HYBRID_SUBMISSION.md` cover letter template; trim to venue length.  

## Grants/Polygon Next Steps
- Grant brief: `docs/GRANT_BRIEF_POLYGON.md` (updated proof-of-work, options contract, 46 tests).  
- To strengthen grant apps: deploy SolarPunkOption to testnet, set `VITE_OPTION_ADDRESS`, capture a short demo, and optionally get a partner LOI.
