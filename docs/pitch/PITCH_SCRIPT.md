**(0:00-0:10) THE HOOK**
*   **Visual:** Show a chart of "Negative Energy Prices" (Curtailment).
*   **Audio:** "This is the biggest failure in the energy transition. Solar farms are losing billions because they can't hedge against volatility. The sun shines, prices drop, they lose money."

**(0:10-0:25) THE SOLUTION**
*   **Visual:** Switch to **SolarPunk Protocol Frontend**. Show the "Hedge Revenue" button.
*   **Audio:** "Introducing SolarPunk Protocol. It’s a decentralized clearinghouse on Polygon that lets renewable producers buy 'Revenue Floors'. It works like insurance for the grid."

**(0:25-0:40) THE MAGIC (PILLAR 2 & 3)**
*   **Visual:** Briefly flash the **VS Code Terminal** running `./verify_all.sh` (Green Checks).
*   **Audio:** "But how do you price insurance for a market that doesn't exist? We use NASA Satellite data to price the risk, and a VaR-based Solvency Engine to ensure the payout is guaranteed. It’s not just a token; it’s a math-verified derivative."

**(0:40-0:55) THE ASK**
*   **Visual:** Scroll through the `SolarPunkOption.sol` code or the "150% Solvency" badge.
*   **Audio:** "We have the Empirics, the Math, and the Code. We are asking for a pilot grant to execute the first on-chain hedge for a real solar farm."

**(0:55-1:00) THE CLOSE**
*   **Visual:** Your face.
*   **Audio:** "Let’s stop wasting clean energy. Let’s financialize the transition. Thank you."
