# SOLARPUNK PIVOT OVERVIEW (ENERGY CREDIT + HEDGING)

## ONE-SENTENCE PIVOT
Shift from "stablecoin" framing to "energy credit + revenue floor hedging" for microgrids and renewable producers.

## PROBLEM (GRANT-FRIENDLY)
- Renewable energy is curtailed and wasted.
- Small producers cannot access hedge products.
- Revenue volatility blocks new capacity.

## SOLUTION (RE-FRAMED)
SolarPunk issues verified energy credits and offers on-chain revenue floor hedges. Credits are minted only from verified surplus and are redeemable within partner ecosystems.

## WHAT CHANGES
- Emphasis: energy credits + hedging, not a "money printing" stablecoin.
- Token: settlement credit tied to verified surplus, not a general-purpose currency.
- Narrative: monetize curtailment, not create value from nothing.

## WHAT STAYS
- Oracle-driven pricing and settlement
- On-chain risk controls and margining
- Simulation + testing evidence
- Polygon as the execution layer

## CORE CLAIMS (SAFE TO USE)
- "We monetize curtailed energy by issuing verified credits and hedging revenue risk."
- "Credits are minted only from verified surplus and redeemable in a partner network."
- "Revenue comes from premiums and fees, not from token issuance."

## DO NOT SAY
- "Prints money" or "free money"
- "Guaranteed stable" without caveats
- "Currency" unless it is explicitly limited to settlement in partner systems
