# VALUE FLOW (NO FREE MONEY MODEL)

## WHO PAYS
- Energy buyers (microgrid users, utilities, or partners)
- Hedgers seeking revenue protection
- Protocol users paying settlement or premium fees

## WHO RECEIVES
- Producers selling verified surplus
- Hedgers receiving payouts when prices fall
- Protocol treasury (fees)

## FLOW (SIMPLIFIED)
1) Producer generates surplus energy.
2) Surplus is verified by oracle data sources.
3) Energy credits are minted only for verified surplus.
4) Credits are sold or used as settlement for hedging contracts.
5) Hedging premiums flow to liquidity or treasury.
6) Payouts settle when energy price falls below floor.

## REAL REVENUE SOURCES
- Option premiums
- Settlement fees
- Integration fees for data/oracle services

## WHY THIS IS NOT "FREE MONEY"
- Credits are liabilities backed by real production.
- Issuance is constrained by verified surplus.
- Buyers pay for hedging and settlement value.
