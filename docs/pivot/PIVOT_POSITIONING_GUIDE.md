# PIVOT POSITIONING GUIDE (PUBLIC VS INTERNAL)

## CORE IDEA (PLAIN ENGLISH)
We turn verified surplus renewable energy into settlement credits and offer revenue-floor hedges so producers can stabilize cashflow.

## ONE-LINE PITCH (PUBLIC)
SolarPunk monetizes curtailed renewable energy with on-chain settlement credits and revenue-floor hedges for microgrids.

## ONE-LINE PITCH (TECH)
Oracle-verified surplus energy mints settlement credits; options contracts provide a revenue floor and settle on-chain.

## NAME OPTIONS (SAFE)
- SolarPunk Energy Credits (SPK)
- SolarPunk Settlement Credits
- SolarPunk Energy Hedge Protocol

## WHAT THE TOKEN IS (SAFE DEFINITION)
A settlement credit minted only from verified surplus energy and redeemable within partner microgrid or utility programs.

## WHAT IT IS NOT (DO NOT SAY)
- A general-purpose stablecoin
- A currency that "prints money"
- Guaranteed stability without constraints

## VALUE LOOP (SHORT)
- Verified surplus -> credits minted
- Credits settle hedges or redeem within partner systems
- Protocol earns fees on hedging premiums and settlement

## GRANT-FRIENDLY FRAMING
- Problem: curtailment destroys revenue; small producers lack hedges
- Solution: settlement credits + revenue-floor hedging
- Impact: reduces volatility, improves producer cashflow, supports grid stability

## PUBLIC VS INTERNAL TERMINOLOGY
- Public: energy credits, settlement, hedging, revenue floor
- Internal: peg control, PI tuning, liquidation, margining

## FAQ-STYLE ANSWERS
- "Is this a stablecoin?" -> "It is a settlement credit tied to verified energy, not a general currency."
- "How is it backed?" -> "Issued only from verified surplus energy; redemption is limited to partner systems."
- "Where does revenue come from?" -> "Premiums, settlement fees, and data/oracle integration fees."
