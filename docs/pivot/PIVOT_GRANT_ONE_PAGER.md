# PIVOT GRANT ONE-PAGER (ENERGY CREDIT + HEDGING)

## SUMMARY
SolarPunk converts curtailed renewable energy into verified on-chain credits and provides revenue floor hedges for small producers. The system uses oracle-fed pricing and on-chain settlement to reduce volatility and monetize stranded energy.

## WHY IT MATTERS
- Curtailment destroys revenue and slows renewable buildout.
- Small producers lack access to hedge products.
- Energy credits + hedging unlock predictable cashflows.

## WHAT EXISTS TODAY
- Deployed contracts (testnet pending RPC/keys)
- 46 tests passing across core contracts
- Pricing and risk tooling validated with simulation

## WHAT WE WILL DELIVER
- Security audit + remediation
- Oracle data service + monitoring
- Pilot microgrid hedge + settlement credits
- UI/SDK for partner onboarding

## WHY POLYGON
Low fees make micro-hedges viable. RWA-aligned ecosystem and strong sustainability focus.

## WHY CHAINLINK
Oracle aggregation and settlement reliability are core to this system.

## METRICS
- Testnet addresses + health check output
- Pilot hedge executed on-chain
- Verified surplus credits minted and redeemed
- Stability tuning report published
