# GRANT DUAL-TRACK PLAN (POLYGON + CHAINLINK)

## GOAL
Maximize approval odds by splitting scope into two non-overlapping grant narratives.

## TRACK A: POLYGON COMMUNITY GRANTS
- Purpose: Mainnet deployment + pilot execution + UI/SDK
- Budget: $50k baseline + $25k stretch
- Value to Polygon: new RWA/DeFi primitive, Polygon-native usage

## TRACK B: CHAINLINK GRANT
- Purpose: Oracle data service + aggregation + monitoring + integration
- Budget: $20k
- Value to Chainlink: real-world energy data feeds + oracle-driven settlement

## NON-OVERLAP STATEMENT
Polygon funds audit, pilot, UI/SDK, and deployment. Chainlink funds oracle data service and integration. No double-funding.

## PROOF POINTS TO INCREASE ODDS
1) Testnet deployment addresses + health check output
2) 3-minute demo video
3) One pilot LOI or documented outreach

## SUBMISSION ORDER
1) Polygon (primary)
2) Chainlink (secondary, parallel)

## CURRENT STATUS
- Tests: 46 passing
- Simulation: baseline 6.5% in-band; PI tuning needed
- Deployments: testnet pending RPC/keys
