# SolarPunkCoin: One-Page Executive Summary

## Energy-Backed Stablecoins on Polygon

---

### THE OPPORTUNITY

**Problem:**
- Stablecoins face trust and stability risks
- Renewable energy is curtailed with no monetization path
- No decentralized stablecoin with direct physical anchoring

**Solution:**
SolarPunkCoin (SPK) anchors stability to renewable energy using PI control from engineering.

---

### WHAT WE'VE BUILT

- Production-grade smart contract (500+ lines, Solidity 0.8.20)
- 46 unit tests (36 SPK + 10 Options)
- Empirical validation (1000-day Monte Carlo; baseline 6.5% in-band, PI tuning needed)
- Energy derivatives library (PyPI published)
- Academic foundation (research papers + thesis materials)

**Current Status:** Testnet deployment ready; addresses pending (RPC/keys needed)

---

### THE ASK

**Funding:** $50,000 USD (baseline) | $75,000 USD (stretch)
**Duration:** 6 months

**What it funds:**
- Security audit and remediation
- Oracle data service + monitoring
- Stability tuning and market ops automation
- Pilot setup + liquidity incentives
- UI/SDK for non-dev users

---

### TARGET OUTCOMES (BY END OF GRANT)

- Polygon mainnet deployment with audit report
- 1 pilot hedge executed and documented
- Stability tuning report published
- 1-2 academic submissions
- 100+ GitHub stars and an initial user community

### MARKET SIZE

| Market | Addressable | SPK Target |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Stablecoin market | $2T+ | 1-5% = $1-5B |
| Renewable curtailment | $50-100B wasted | 5-10% = $2.5-10B |
| CBDC applications | 190+ countries | Government adoption = $100B+ |

---

### COMPETITIVE POSITION

| Feature | USDC | DAI | UST | SPK |
|---------|------|-----|-----|-----|
| Decentralization | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| Real backing | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Capital efficient | Yes | Partial | N/A | Yes |
| Climate impact | No | No | No | Yes |
| Peg stability | Yes | Yes | No | In progress |

**SPK's unique advantage:** real backing + decentralization + climate impact + capital efficiency

- Blockchain development (working code, deployment scripts ready)
- Quantitative analysis (Monte Carlo simulations)

**Advisory Support (In-Kind):**
- Finance professor (thesis advisor)
- Control systems engineer (validation)
- Energy economics researcher (partnerships)

---

### RISKS & MITIGATION

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Oracle manipulation | Multi-source feeds, circuit breakers, staleness gating |
| Regulatory uncertainty | Energy/RWA framing, legal templates |
| Partnership delays | Parallel outreach + contingency pilot design |
| Security vulnerabilities | Professional audit + remediation |
| Adoption slow | Academic credibility + developer ecosystem |

---

### TIMELINE

- Months 1-2: Security audit + testnet deployment
- Months 3-4: Oracle service + stability tuning
- Months 5-6: Pilot execution + UI/SDK

---

### SUSTAINABILITY & ROI

Year 1: Proof-of-concept funded by grant
Year 2: Scale via partnerships + follow-on funding
Year 3+: Fee-based revenue from hedging activity

---

### IMPACT

**Climate:** Monetizes wasted renewable energy
**Financial:** Decentralized stability mechanism with real-world backing
**Institutional:** Blueprint for energy-linked on-chain finance
