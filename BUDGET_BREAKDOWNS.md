**This is NOT a traditional grant. It's community voting.**

To win, you need:
1. **Twitter presence:** Tweet about grant launch
2. **Community engagement:** Email energy/climate communities
3. **Donation activity:** Get 50+ people to donate (even $5)
4. **Quadratic matching:** Every donation triggers larger match

**Messages to amplify:**
- "First open-source renewable energy derivatives protocol"

## How to Present This

### In Grant Form (Example for Polygon)
**"How will you use the $75,000?"**

> "SolarPunk will allocate grant funding as follows:
> 
> - **$25,000:** Oracle hardening and Polygon PoS optimization
> - **$20,000:** Security testing and audit preparation
> - **18,000:** Testnet pilot deployment with 3 solar farms
> - **$12,000:** Marketing and community engagement
> 
> Timeline: 6 months from award to mainnet-ready status. Monthly transparency reports provided to Polygon foundation."

### Success Criterion
Each budget line item should answer:
- **What?** (What work is being done)
- **Why?** (Why is it necessary for the grant's goals)
- **How much?** (Realistic cost estimate)
- **When?** (Timeline milestone)

## FINAL CHECKLIST

Before submitting ANY application:

- [ ] Budget totals match grant request amount
- [ ] Each line item explains WHY (not just WHAT)
- [ ] Timeline is realistic (not overpromised)
- [ ] Budget aligns with funder's priorities
- [ ] Can you defend each number? (No random amounts)
- [ ] Do you have receipts/quotes for major items? (Not required but helpful)
- [ ] Is 20-30% contingency included? (For unexpected costs)

**Pro tip:** If grant says "max $100K" and you're planning $98K, ask yourself: "Can I do this for $75K instead?" Having budget room shows confidence.
