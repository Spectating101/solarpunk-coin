Dear Selection Committee,

I am pleased to submit **"The Invisible Ledger: Fiscal Decoupling in ASEAN's Super-App Economy"** for presentation at the Asian Economic Development Conference (AEDC) in Hong Kong.

## Alignment with Conference Themes

This paper directly addresses the challenge of **Domestic Resource Mobilization** and **Digital Economy Measurement** in Asia. 

As ASEAN member states (Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia) grapple with the fiscal implications of digitalization, this research provides the first **census-level estimate** of the "invisible economy"—economic activity that flows to informal agents (drivers, merchants, creators) and systematically bypasses traditional GDP measurement and tax nets.

## Key Contributions

1.  **Quantifying the Fiscal Gap**: Using audited financial filings from ASEAN's three dominant platforms (Grab, GoTo, and Sea Ltd) as a calibration standard, I document an **$83 billion** invisible wedge in Indonesia alone, with a fiscal multiplier of 12.5x. For every $1 of corporate revenue taxed, $12.50 flows to the informal sector, largely untaxed.

2.  **Regional Scope**: The paper extends this methodology to estimate a total **$185 billion** invisible economy across five ASEAN nations, validating these estimates against actual Digital Services Tax (DST) collections (Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, Thailand).

3.  **Policy Framework for Inclusive Growth**: The paper argues against blunt tax instruments that might stifle the gig economy. Instead, it proposes a **bifurcated fiscal framework**:
    *   **Zero-Rated Formalization** for low-income gig workers (enhancing financial inclusion without tax burdens).
    *   **Algorithmic Withholding** for high-income digital rents (ensuring fair contribution from top-tier creators/merchants).

## Relevance for Policymakers

This research is particularly timely given the ongoing implementation of OECD Pillar One and the need for Asian governments to design independent fiscal policies that protect their tax base without hindering digital innovation. The findings offer a concrete, data-driven evidence base for "Fiscal Decoupling"—the divergence between corporate profits and the broader economic activity they facilitate.

## Travel Support Request

As a Master's student at Yuan Ze University (Taiwan), I respectfully request consideration for **travel support / funding** to attend the conference. This research was conducted independently, and presenting these findings to the AEDC/ADB community would be a pivotal opportunity to contribute to regional policy discussions.

## Author Background

[Your Name] is a Master's student at Yuan Ze University, specializing in digital economy measurement and fiscal policy in Southeast Asia. This research is based on extensive analysis of audited corporate filings and government revenue data.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss these findings with the conference participants.

Sincerely,
